# Java Online Chat Program

### Server Setup
1. Launch the program
2. Type S (To launch the server)
3. Watch the chat

### Client Setup
1. Launch the program
2. Type C (To launch the client)
3. Participate in conversation with other clients!

This program necessitates a server running to host all the chat operations. This server is unable to participate in conversation but receives logs and can monitor the chat.
The client can connect to the server's IP (with the appropriate port) and may participate in conversation with other connected clients. The client is first prompted with their username before joining the server.
